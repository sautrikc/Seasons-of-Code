# Seasons-of-Code
This repository stores all the code which is a part of the project 'CNN based stock market prediction'

First, I explored the different concepts related to Time Series modelling such as seasonality, trend and long term oscillations. This was followed by different classifications of time series data. Next, I learnt about the different methods associated with time series modelling and when to use them. These include AR, MA, ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing etc. This was followed by learning about basic concepts related to machine learning and deep learning. These include regression, regularisation, classification, ensemble techniques and ANNs.

Next, I moved to learning about Convolutional Neural Networks. Here, I performed a CNN based image classification for the presence of viral pneumonia in CT scans. I learnt about the basic algorithms and architecture of CNN. Following this, I moved to the project and am in the process of Exploratory Data Analysis for the dataset.
